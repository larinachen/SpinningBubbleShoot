# Spinning Bubble Shoot
Arcade game built in C++, inspired by the classic Bubble Shooter game - I just added a ~ spin ~ to it :)


## How to play
1. Press space bar to shoot, use left/right arrow keys to spin the shooter
2. Try to hit bubbles in the same color as the bullet shot from the shooter
3. Beware! Wrong hits makes new bubbles stuck to the chain of original bubbles **and makes the chain spins faster**
4. Win when you've cleared all the bubbles. Lose when you accumulate enough bubbles on the screen to hit the forbbiden zone.
5. Good luck!
